- I chose to do the Canvas tutorial as it reminded me of some of the first coding projects I ever did.

- My code takes the tutorials from the following links and makes them into functions:
Canvas Intro:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp
Canvas Drawing:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_drawing.asp
Canvas Coordinates:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_coordinates.asp
Canvas Lines:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_lines.asp
Canvas Fill and Stroke:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_fill_stroke.asp
Canvas Shapes:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_shapes.asp
Canvas Rectangles:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_rectangles.asp
Canvas clearRect():https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_clearrect.asp
Canvas Circles:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_circles.asp
Canvas Linear Gradient:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_gradients.asp
Canvas Text:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_text.asp
Canvas Transformations:https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_transformations.asp

- As mentioned prior, my code is based on examples from all of the above links.
The change I made was largely making all of the examples into usable functions.
Aside from that, I just changed sizes and colors and made a single page of shapes.
I simply implemented a web page that drew text and several polygons in different 
colors using the canvas tag (and some are indeed gradient).
